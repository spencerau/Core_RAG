## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Patty
1. Form the ground beef into evenly sized patties.  
2. Season both sides with salt, pepper, and any optional spices.  
3. Heat a pan or grill to medium-high and cook patties for 3–4 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.

### 2. Make the Sauce
1. Combine mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, and seasoning.  
2. Mix until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

### 3. Toast the Buns
1. Lightly butter or oil the buns if desired.  
2. Toast them cut-side down in a pan or on the grill until golden.

### 4. Assemble the Burger
1. Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun.  
2. Add cheese if using.  
3. Layer lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles.  
4. Spread the sauce on the top bun.  
5. Close and serve immediately.

## Notes
- For a richer flavor, chill the sauce for at least 10 minutes before assembling.  
- If you want a more cartoon-accurate Krabby Patty, add a small pinch of Old Bay to the final assembly for an extra "Poseidon Powder" kick.
